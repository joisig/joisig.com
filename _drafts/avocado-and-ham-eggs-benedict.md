This is quite a bit off my usual topics of startups and tech, but a friend asked for the recipe and I figured I'd post it for posterity.

### Ingredients (2 portions)

1 avocado

2 English muffins or - for Icelanders, two halves of a "skonsa" from Ömmubakstur

5 eggs

A bit of lemon juice

Cayenne pepper

1 tablespoon table vinegar (borðedik)

A couple or a few slices of ham

80g butter

Optional:

* 8 pieces of bacon
* Strawberries or blueberries or a green salad for the side

### Implements

You will need a medium-sized deep bowl, a medium-sized whisk, and a small saucepan that takes about 1.5 liters, and ideally has a handle and a "lip" or a spout for pouring, or if it doesn't have a lip or spout, a separate jug or similar, with a lip or spout.
