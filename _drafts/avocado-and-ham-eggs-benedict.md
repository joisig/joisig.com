This is quite a bit off my usual topics of startups and tech, but a good friend of mine asked for the recipe and I figured I'd post it for posterity. It's an eggs Benedict recipe I put together out of a few others and made many times over during a recent paternity leave. I'll also describe a nice keto/LCHF variation on the recipe.

### Ingredients (2 portions)

1 avocado

2 English muffins, or - for English-muffin-starved Icelanders, two halves of a "skonsa" from Ömmubakstur

5 eggs

A bit of lemon juice

1 tablespoon 4% table vinegar (borðedik) or 1/3rd of that, about one tap, if you get vinegar acid (ediksýra, 14%)

A couple or a few slices of ham

80g butter

A bit of Dijon mustard

Optional:

* Cayenne pepper
* 8 pieces of bacon
* Strawberries and/or blueberries and/or a green salad for the side

### Implements

You will need:

* A smallish, deep bowl like a breakfast cereal bowl
* A medium-sized whisk (not too large to use in that bowl)
* A small saucepan that takes about 1.5 liters, and ideally has a handle and a "lip" or a spout for pouring
* If your saucepan doesn't have a lip or spout that will let you pour a thin stream of melted butter, you'll also need a separate jug or similar, with a lip or spout
* A kettle or a separate saucepan to boil water

### Method

First off, do some prep:

1. Bring up two plates, put a toasted English muffin on each, or half a "skonsa" (without toasting), or a piece of freshly-toasted toast with some butter on it.
2. Spread a bit of Dijon mustard on the bread, to taste; I like about a teaspoon on each.
3. Add a slice or two of ham on top of the mustard
4. Halve the avocado, remove the stone, slice each half into 6-10 long slices, and "fan" the slices over the bread and ham
5. Put the butter in your saucepan and bring it to quick heat. You can turn the heat off once it starts sizzling
6. While the butter is melting, boil about 1 liter of water in your kettle

Next, make your hollandaise sauce:

1. Separate one egg and place the yolk in a smallish, deep bowl, like a breakfast cereal bowl. To separate the egg, I find it simplest to crack it carefully in two, leaving the yolk in one half, then use the cracked shell to allow the white to drop to a separate bowl if you want to store it, or straight into the trash if not.
2. Add about 1/3rd of the volume of the yolk of lemon juice to your bowl
3. Season with a bit of salt and optionally a fair bit of cayenne pepper, this goes well with the other ingredients but can be skipped
4. Put a folded dishtowel under your bowl, this makes it easier to whisk without the bowl flying away or starting to turn once your hollandaise sauce starts to get thick
5. Whisk the yolk and lemon juice until light and fluffy
6. If you don't have a lip or spout on your saucepan that will let you pour a thin stream of melted butter, you need to first transfer the melted butter to some kind of jug that you can easily pour a thin stream out of
7. Pour a thin stream of melted butter into the bowl while whisking hard the entire time. The sauce should start to thicken and become an emulsion. If you're ever unsure if it's mixing well enough, stop pouring and whisk for a while, then keep pouring. This takes a couple of minutes and you can get a bit tired from whisking the first few times you make the recipe.
8. Wait a couple of minutes (you can start on the poached eggs), then
