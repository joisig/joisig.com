Hi! I&#8217;m Jói Sigurðsson.

Jói is pronounced YO-i. YO as in yoghurt, i as in independent. That&#8217;s me. Independent yoghurt.

I left Google in April 2014 after nine and a half years working on products such as Google Desktop and Google Chrome. Instead of a super cushy job with a world class company, my plan was to spend lots of time and money working on startups that may or may not succeed, may or may not change the world, and may or may not provide free lunch and on-site massages, but would probably be fun. In a way I went back to my roots, as I was &#8220;doing startups&#8221; before I joined Google, way before it was cool.

Crazy, huh?

This blog documents my post-Google journey. My first startup after Google is called CrankWheel, and it does specialized screen sharing for sales team. [Its main web page](http://crankwheel.com/) is here, and you can see some details about [the genesis of CrankWheel here](http://joisig.com/?p=28 "Introducing CrankWheel").
