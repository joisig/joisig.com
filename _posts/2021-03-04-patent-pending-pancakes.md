Here is the best recipe for Icelandic pancakes that I've found.

## This patent is public domain!

Most Icelandic pancake recipes are virtually identical, but the devil is in the details. The recipe I use is a slightly modified version of [this one by Eva Laufey Kjaran](https://evalaufeykjaran.is/islenskar-ponnukokur-me-sultu-og-rjoma/) (I use a bit more butter). It tastes great and is very unlikely to stick to the pan. I'm publishing my variation in English so Icelandophiles worldwide can benefit.

## Ingredients:
*	3 dl wheat
*	1 tbsp sugar
*	1/2 tsp baking powder
*	5 dl milk
*	2 eggs
*	1/2 tsp vanilla drops
*	40 g butter

## Instructions

1.	Melt the butter in your [Icelandic pancake pan](https://nammi.is/icelandic-pancake-pan.html). Take off heat when the butter starts to sputter, leave melted butter in pan until you use it in step 5
2.	Mix all dry ingredients in a large bowl. You can mix by hand with a beater.
3.	Take part of the milk, 3 dl, add to dry ingredients, stir by hand into lump-free mixture
4.	Add one egg at a time and blend
5.	Add the rest of the milk and vanilla drops, and pour the melted butter off the pan, leaving as little as possible on the pan. Beat together, mixture should be quite thin
6.	Put the pan on high heat, wait until the remaining butter starts to brown slightly
7.	Use a slightly larger amount of batter for your first pancake; this will soak up the excess butter
8.	For each pancake, pour a thin layer, turning the pan. Wait until the entire surface dries a bit (stops being near-white) then use the spatula to find an edge and flip the pancake
9.	Leave on second side 5-10 seconds, then place on serving dish
10.	Next pancake! Over time, try to adjust temperature so pancakes turn out golden brown on the first side. Roughly medium-high heat

Typical serving is to either sugar and roll up each pancake just before eating, or to spread a bit of (traditionally rhubarb) jam and a tablespoon of whipped cream and fold the pancake in 4 just before eating.

## Important

*	Never wash your Icelandic pancake pan with soap. It will get better and better over time and may blacken, this is normal. If needed, just wipe it clean with a kitchen towel. Only use the pan for pancakes.
*	The best type of spatula to use with an Icelandic pancake pan is a steel spatula about 20 cm long, straight-edged, not too wide (an inch or less) with a rounded end. You can get these from many suppliers.
*	If your pancakes stick to the pan, the most likely reason is too much sugar in your batter.
*	If they still stick, try „seasoning“ the pan again by once or twice melting and slightly burning some butter on it, allowing to cool, wiping off. Remember, never use soap!
