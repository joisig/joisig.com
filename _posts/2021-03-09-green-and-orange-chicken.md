This was a favorite of our au pair who left a few days ago, and I'm publishing it here for her (hi Helmiina!!) and for anybody else who would like to try it. It's very tasty and easy to make, you need to start about an hour before you want to eat but all of the prep and hands-on cooking is only about 15 minutes.

## Ingredients for 3-4 servings:
*	8 boneless chicken thighs, roughly 700g (can also use breasts or tenders)
*   Chicken spice mix, I use Schwarz's bought in Costco
*   One large sweet potato, peeled and cubed
*   Half a bag of spinach leaves
*   One jar of cubed feta cheese in oil with onions and spices
*   8 Ritz crackers, crumbled
*   Olive oil
*   Some butter

## Instructions

1.	Heat your oven to 200 C
1.  Toss your diced sweet potatoes in olive oil. I like to season with onion powder and a bit of salt, and either garlic powder or some whole cloves of garlic.
1.  Put the diced sweet potatoes into an oven-proof casserole dish, big enough that the sweet potatoes fill it up about half-way.
1.  Put the sweet potatoes into the oven, leave for about 10 minutes, then lower to 180 C.
1.  Leave the sweet potatoes in for another 15 minutes before starting to fry your chicken, maybe a bit longer. Before you start frying the chicken, the sweet potatoes should be easy to poke through with a fork, although not completely soft yet.
1.  Season your chicken well, and brown in a frying pan for about 3 minutes on each side in olive oil and some butter.
1.  Now, take the sweet potatoes out of the oven and assemble. Put the spinach on top of the sweet potatoes, then the chicken, then crumble the Ritz crackers on top. Finally, spread the feta cheese cubes over the chicken along with a good amount of the oil and spices.
1.  Put that all back in the oven for about 18 minutes, then you're done.

## Low-carb alternative

For a low-carb alternative, use a head of cauliflower cut into florets instead of the sweet potatoes, and use half the amount of Ritz crackers.
