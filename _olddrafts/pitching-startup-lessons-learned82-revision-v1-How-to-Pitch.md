# How to pitch

I was recently asked to give a talk on how to pitch a startup, and I figured since I'm building a deck and gathering resources for the talk, why not write it up as well.

I’m far from the biggest pitching expert in the world, but I’ve pitched [CrankWheel](http://crankwheel.com/?ref=startupresources) on stage at multiple conferences around the world, and I’ve won pitching competitions a couple of times. I’ve also been angel investing for the last 5 years, so I’ve seen my fair share of both good and bad pitch decks.

## Why pitch?

You pitch for multiple reasons, all of them in the end having to do with promoting your startup. These include:

  1. Attracting investors
  2. Selling to customers
  3. Finding partners
  4. Hiring people
  5. Trying to win a pitch competition

In this presentation, we’ll focus on pitching in general, i.e. the art of promoting your startup through an in-person presentation, and on the type of material you would include in a pitch deck if you are pitching to attract investors.

### Decks to send vs. decks to present

There are two broad categories of pitch deck for startups seeking investment:

  1. The one that is only intended to be shown with you presenting the pitch live.
  2. The one that you can email an investor and leave with them. This is what an investor wants when they ask you to email them a pitch deck. It needs to have a lot more details and typically more slides than the first type.

We’ll focus on the first type, the one you deliver in person, but there are many links to resources on pitch decks you can email in the resources section.

## Pitch basics

### Make your deck look nice

Your slides should look nice. Get a designer to help you, or buy a PowerPoint template you can customize – for example, the templates for my slides (shown below) were purchased at [GraphicRiver](https://graphicriver.net/category/presentation-templates?ref=joisig). I also found a [good-looking template that is specialized for pitch decks](https://transactions.sendowl.com/stores/4167/45499) (they also have a [nice infographic about how to pitch](https://transactions.sendowl.com/stores/4198/45499)). You can also find lots of free PowerPoint and Keynote templates online.

### Listen to Guy Kawasaki

Follow [Guy Kawasaki’s 10/20/30 advice](https://guykawasaki.com/the-only-10-slides-you-need-in-your-pitch/): No more than 10 slides that should take no more than 20 minutes to deliver, and no font should be smaller than 30 points. That last bit prevents you from having slides that are too text-rich.

### Practice until perfect

Practice your pitch until you can deliver it without reading from any notes, and with maximum emotional impact.

I am dead serious about this. When people get up on stage and the pressure builds and they want to deliver their pitch but haven't practised enough, I've seen very bad things happen.

Ideally, you should be able to give a perfect rendition of your pitch while a friend stands in front of you, screaming insults, jokes and math quizzes in your face.

Personally, I spend hours perfecting my delivery, and even for a pitch I've delivered a few times before, I still need a couple of hours to refresh my memory so I can deliver it just right.

## Emotional hooks

My number one piece of advice is that you need to find a way to have your audience connect emotionally to what you’re telling them.

### Basic: Ask about experiences in the past

The simplest thing is to ask them a question that reminds them of a painful or joyful experience related to the problem you’re trying to solve. For example if you’re improving pizza delivery you might ask the audience “when was the last time your pizza arrived cold”?

If it’s something they may not have directly experienced, you can do the same through somebody they care deeply about. For example, if you have a solution to make computer games even more engaging, you could ask them “have you ever seen your kids so deeply engrossed in a computer game you couldn’t talk to them?”

### Advanced: Directly give them an experience

Even better is if you can directly give them an experience during your pitch that lets them connect on an emotional level then and there. I'll give you a couple of examples from some of my own pitches of [CrankWheel](http://crankwheel.com/?ref=startupresources):

  1. I gave a pitch where I was highlighting the fact that being able to quickly [show things visually](http://crankwheel.com/ready-in-seconds/?ref=startupresources) can really help you communicate better over the phone. To give them the emotional connection, early on in the pitch I asked the audience to close their eyes. I then proceeded to try to describe the clothes I was wearing. About 10 seconds in, I asked them to open their eyes, and to notice that now that they can actually see what I'm wearing, it both takes much less time than listening to me describe it, and they have a much more correct understanding.
  2. Another pitch I did was to illustrate the importance of being able to [get software demos instantly](http://crankwheel.com/instant-demos/?ref=startupresources), instead of waiting for days. At the start of this pitch, I told the audience &#8220;I know you're ready and interested in hearing my pitch&#8221;, and asked them if they'd like to go ahead. When they said yes, I told them &#8220;OK, just fill in this simple form (while showing a form with 15 fields on it), and I'll get back to you within a couple of days to book a meeting where you can get to hear my pitch.&#8221; Right then and there, they've experienced how silly and frustrating it is when you visit a website and want to know about some piece of software, to have to request a demo and only get more information days from now.

## Parts of a pitch

A typical investor pitch should cover roughly the following areas, often in roughly this order:

  1. One-liner / elevator pitch
  2. Team
  3. Problem
  4. Solution
  5. Your (ideally unfair) advantage
  6. Product (demo or slides showing it)
  7. Your traction
  8. Market analysis and go-to-market plan
  9. Competitive analysis
 10. Business model
 11. Investment ask
 12. Contact details

These definitely don't all need to be stand-alone slides. For a pitch deck you're presenting, you'll not want to drown your audience in details on each slide either.

This is just a rough order you can work with, but you can definitely change it around. For example, if your team doesn't consist of industry veterans with a proven track record, then you might not want to make that slide number two. Get to your strengths and your &#8220;wow factor&#8221; as quickly as you can in the deck.

Let's look at pitch deck slides from some well-known companies as examples of each part of the pitch:

### 1. The elevator pitch
